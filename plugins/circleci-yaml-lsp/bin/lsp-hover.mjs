// Proxy-side hover for CircleCI YAML configs.
//
// The upstream circleci-yaml-language-server advertises hoverProvider but
// returns null for all positions (stub as of 0.35.x). This module implements
// hover directly: it finds the YAML key under the cursor and returns the
// markdownDescription extracted from the CircleCI JSON Schema (schema.json).
//
// doHover(text, line, character) -> LSP Hover result object or null
//   text      - full document text
//   line      - 0-based line number
//   character - 0-based character offset

// Descriptions extracted from CircleCI's schema.json (pinned server 0.35.0).
// Source: https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-yaml-language-server/blob/0.35.0/schema.json
// For each property name we take the first markdownDescription found on the
// property, or one level into its oneOf/anyOf/allOf/items/then/else/$ref. Lookup
// is by key name (not full schema position), so a name used in multiple contexts
// resolves to its first definition - a deliberate simplification for hover.
